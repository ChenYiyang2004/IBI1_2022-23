1.The BLOSUM score
	human-mouse:3579
	human-cat:3717
	mouse-cat:3592

2.The	percentage of identical	amino	acids
	human-mouse:82.11%
	human-cat:85.22%
	mouse-cat:81.74%

3.Interpretation
	Because the largest BLOSUM score and percentage of identical amino acids is between human and cat, human and cat have the most related sequences. From these data, we can form a evolutionary interpretation that human and cat may have the closer evolutionary distance than the evolutionary distance of human-mouse and mouse-cat. 
	Additionally, the BLOSUM score and the percentage of identical amino acids of human-mouse and mouse-cat are similar. So, evolutionary distances of mouse to human and cat may be similar.
