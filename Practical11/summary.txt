1.The alignment score
	human-mouse:144
	human-cat:119
	mouse-cat:147

2.The	percentage of identical	amino	acids
	human-mouse:82.11%
	human-cat:85.22%
	mouse-cat:81.74%

3.Conclusion
	Because the largest percentage of identical amino acids is between human and cat, human and cat have the most related sequences. From these data, we can form a evolutionary interpretation that human and cat may have the closer evolutionary distance than the evolutionary distance of human-mouse and mouse-cat. Additionally, 
the percentage of identical amino acids of human-mouse and mouse-cat are similar. So, evolutionary distances of mouse to human and cat may be similar.
